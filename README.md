# 💫 About Me:
Hi, I'm a Computer Science graduate student with a strong focus on  embedded systems, secure communication protocols, and full-stack development. I love turning real-world cybersecurity challenges into hands-on solutions through simulations, IoT experimentation, and mobile app development.<br><br>🔐 Final Year Project<br>📡 A Security Perspective on the LoRaWAN Protocol: Analysis and Countermeasures Against Cyberattacks<br>This project investigates vulnerabilities in the LoRaWAN protocol and implements simulations of replay and jamming attacks.  Arduino MKR WAN 1310 board, a DHT temperature sensor, and a X000016 antenna for MKR WAN 1300 to build a real-world LoRa network.I also evaluated the effectiveness of countermeasures and proposed improvements to bolster network resilience against cyber threats.<br><br> 🧠Featured Projects<br>📱 YumTum (React Native / JavaScript)<br>A mobile restaurant app that brings global flavors to your fingertips.
